Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm cyoa-step3
make: 'cyoa-step1' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1
------------------------------------

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case

Step 1 EC intermediate deadline test 2
===========================================================
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case
Intermediate deadline requirements for Step 1 passed at Sat Nov 19 03:08:26 PM EST 2022

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm cyoa-step3
make: 'cyoa-step2' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
rm cyoa-step3
g++     cyoa-step3.cpp   -o cyoa-step3
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3
------------------------------------

Step 3 EC intermediate deadline test 1
===========================================================
./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case

Step 3 EC intermediate deadline test 2
===========================================================
./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean for this testcase
You have passed this test case
Intermediate deadline requirements for Step 3 passed at Sat Nov 19 03:08:29 PM EST 2022

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
rm cyoa-step3
The code did not compile!
